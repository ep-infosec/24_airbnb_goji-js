# Preparation

## Technical requirements

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

Since Goji is based on the latest version version of React. You should learn how to develop a React
app at first.

- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

We encourage you to write functional components with hooks instead of class components. Some Goji
features like [lifecycle](../guide/lifecycle.md) only support hook API yet.

- At least one Mini Program development experience

We recommend to learn
[WeChat Mini Program](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/dev/component/). Other platforms
are also OK. Including [Baidu](https://smartprogram.baidu.com/docs/develop/component/component/),
[Alipay](https://opendocs.alipay.com/mini/component),
[QQ](https://q.qq.com/wiki/develop/miniprogram/component/) and
[Toutiao](https://developer.toutiao.com/dev/cn/mini-app/develop/component/introduction/basic-component).

## Code editor

We **strongly recommend** using VSCode as your code editor for better developer experience. We also
recommend you install and enable these VSCode plugins.
